# Brill Dots # 

According to wikipedia the **brill** (*Scophthalmus rhombus*) is commonly mistaken for the **petrale sole** (*Eopsetta jordani*) by the local fisherpeople of westcoast Canada. This is a **BIG** mistake, as the brill is considered subpar by the average chef.

These dot files contain the configs that go alongside my dwm,dmenu, and st builds. They include:
- neovim ( auto vim-plug installer included )
- qutebrowser w custom wal theme and homepage
- wal templates and added themes
- status bar scripts made pointlessly painful to read
- a dmenu menu script that does all the things
- more that I do not remember at the moment.
